                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello World! My name is Jorge Perez. I am a 23 year old computer programmer from New York City. I graduated from Hunter College in 2022 with a bachelor's degree of Arts in Computer Science. 
                    In my spare time I develop and program projects while challenging myself to learn new programming skills and techniques. I enjoy combining my creativity skills and programming skills to build 
                    unique and exciting projects that will give users a fun and engaging experience. Other things I really enjoy doing outside of programming are producing music, learning a new art skill, and working out. 
                    Iâ€™m currently programming and improving my skills while building new projects or updating old projects. In the future I aspire to become a software engineer or frontend developer where I can challenge 
                    myself and grow as a programmer.</p>
